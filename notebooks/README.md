# Quick `Julia` example

Find here a humble example of `Julia` usage, `\notebooks\Level_kissing_H_eff_and_Floquet.ipynb`, in the context of the Kerr cat qubit. In this notebook we put to good use the library here developed to explore the level kissing of this experiment. Note that `QuTiP`, or `Python3` for that matter, is not used in this repository and the `.ipynb` extension is only for the sake of casting the code in a pedagogic notebook appereance.

Have fun!
